A simple {\tt .tcl} script is provided for the Cadence Genus synthesis tool. The
script reads the technology files, compiles and elaborates the design, and
proceeds to synthesise it. After synthesis, reports on silicon area usage, power
consumption, and timing closure are generated. A post-synthesis Verilog is
created, which can be used for simulation.
