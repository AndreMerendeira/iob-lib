The provided testbench uses the core instance described in
Section~\ref{sec:inst}. A high level block diagram of the testbench is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tbbd}. The testbench is organised in modular fashion with each
test described in a separate file. The test suite consists of all the test case
files, so that it becomes easy to add, modify or remove tests.
