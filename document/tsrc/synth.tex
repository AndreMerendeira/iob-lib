A simple {\tt .tcl} script is provided for the Cadence Genus synthesis tool. The
script reads the technology files, compiles and elaborates the design, and
proceeds to synthesize it. The timing constraints are contained within the
constraints file provided, or provided in a separate file.

After synthesis, reports on silicon area usage, power consumption, and timing
closure are generated. A post-synthesis Verilog file is created, to be used in
post-synthesis simulation. The IP core has been synthesized without the FIFO
memories, which are treated as black boxes.

It is important not to include the memory models provided in the simulation
directory in synthesis, unless they are to be synthesised as logic or for
FPGA. The memories can be generated for a target technology and included upon
request.
